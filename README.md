# README #

This program was my final project for CSE 219 at Stony Brook. Its purpose is to generate Course Pages for various CSE classes based on Templates. It is currently a working Intellij project so if you download it and open it there it'll be set up and ready to run. There is a jar included in artifacts that will run but it is not always up to date. Finally, you can compile the files manually. The project is dependent on jTPS, DesktopJavaFramework, and PropertiesManager (all included) and javax.jar (from Oracle). 

### Contribution guidelines ###

* You can contribute to this if you'd like but this is no longer my main project so use it how you please but you probably won't hear much from me about it.
